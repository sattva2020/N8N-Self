- Ensure deterministic builds by locking dependencies (e.g., using package-lock.json)
- Run tests in isolated environments to prevent side effects
- Collect and store logs and reports for easy access and debugging
- Set appropriate timeouts for jobs to avoid hanging processes

Make sure to adapt the globs based on your project's specific file structure and requirements.
